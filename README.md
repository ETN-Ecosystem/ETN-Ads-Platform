# ETN Ads Platform Hackathon Challenge

Welcome to the **ETN Ads Platform Hackathon Challenge**! üöÄ

This challenge is designed to encourage developers to contribute to the development of an innovative advertising platform that connects channel owners and advertisers through Telegram and the TON blockchain. The platform allows Telegram channel owners to monetize their channels and advertisers to easily post ads once payments are confirmed.

The **grand prize** for the winner is **$200**! üèÜüí∞

## üìù Overview

The ETN Ads Platform allows:
- **Channel Owners**: To register their Telegram channels, set a price for ad placements, and specify a TON wallet to receive payments in $ETN.
- **Advertisers**: To choose a channel, submit an ad, and pay using $ETN. The ad is automatically posted in the channel once the payment is confirmed.

### Core Features

1. **Channel Registration**: Channel owners can provide a link to their channel, set a price per ad placement, and provide their $ETN wallet address for payments.
2. **Ad Placement**: Advertisers can browse channels, submit ads, and get a $ETN payment link.
3. **Payment Processing**: The platform checks for confirmed payments and posts the ad automatically to the channel.

### Why Participate?
